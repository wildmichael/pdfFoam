# Flamelet Libraries

The steady laminar flamelet libraries for the tutorial cases were generated
with the FlameMaster software by H. Pitsch [[FlameMaster]](../../../doc/references.md#FlameMaster).
First, a transient flamelet solution is obtained, which is then used as a
initial guess for the steady-state solution. For some of the steady flamelet
libraries, there are two input files, `FlameMaster.input` and
`FlameMasterDown.input`. They are used to obtain the profiles for increasing
and decreasing scalar dissipation rates, respectively. From the steady
solutions, the `pdfFoam` input files are generated by the
[genFlameletTables](../../tools/genFlameletTables) script. The procedure is as
follows:

```sh
$ cd tutorials/flamelet/<name>/initial
$ mkdir -p output
$ FlameMaster
$ cd ../steady
$ mkdir -p output
$ FlameMaster -i FlameMaster.input
$ # only run if FlameMasterDown.input exists
$ test -f FlameMasterDown.input && FlameMaster -i FlameMasterDown.input
$ ../../tools/genFlameletTables output/CH4*chi*[0-9]
```

This creates the files `z`, `chi`, `rho` and `T` which should be moved to
`&lt;case&gt;/constant/flamelet/`
